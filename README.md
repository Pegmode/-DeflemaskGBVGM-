# Deflemask Game Boy Engine (DGB)
Custom Deflemask .vgm based music playback engine for the Nintendo Game Boy. Now the official Deflemask ROM exporter as of Deflemask v1.0.3.

**this engine only works with Deflemask generated .vgms and is not intended for other .vgms**

supports `EExx` event commands from Delfemask and uses proper engine timings instead of .vgm update timings. Converter converts .vgm to either .gbs, .bin or .gb.

*"High on time efficiency, low on space efficiency."*

Formerly known as Deflemask GBVGM (DMGBVGM)


## Usage
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Pegmode/-DeflemaskGBVGM-/releases/latest)  
2. run DeflemaskGBVGMConverter.exe like this

#### Sync command
Sync signals write to HRAM with the address specified in `DEFAULT_SYNC_HIGH_ADDRESS` in the converter (default `0x80`). In deflemask use the `EExx` command to write the value xx to `DEFAULT_SYNC_HIGH_ADDRESS`.
